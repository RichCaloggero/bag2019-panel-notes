# Brainstorming Panel Questions

## What are the advantages of having people with disabilities do accessibility testing?
- more easily do manual checks since familiar with tools (screen reader, magnification)
- motovation

## What are some of the challenges of having people with disabilities conduct WCAG 2.0 compliance testing?  
- sometimes too close "I developed a workaround -- it's accessible"
- need to be an expert to understand W3C


## How can these challenges be overcome? 
- consider a11y QA testing separately from a11y UX (UX testing with real users, a11y QA by experts)

	+ very helpful to know JS and have at least some experience implementing simple things (DOM manipulation)
- UX tester:
	+ very familiar with their tools (screen reader, magnification, speech recognition) and it's idiosyncracies
